# KCPromise

An ObjectiveC implementation of the Promises/A+ proposal.
Full specs can be found at http://promisesaplus.com/.

The implementation follows all Promise/A+ specs, excepting the ones not aplicable to ObjectiveC (specifically section 2.3.3).

The current implementation doesn't yet implement circular promise chain detectopn, support for this will be added later on.
